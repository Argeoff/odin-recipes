    Scotch eggs are soft-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and bread crumbs, deep-fried for a delicious savory treat. They're a British pub favorite, perfect for family occasions or picnics. We like to make these on Christmas Eve served on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes and mustard for garnish.
